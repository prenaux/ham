# Ham

**Ham** is a language agnostic 'make' replacement and a virtual build environment.

It aims to provide an easily replicable build and development environment
that can be setup automatically on any Windows, OSX & Linux machines.

Once the repository has been cloned **ham** will automatically fetch all the tools
needed to complete a build of various kind of software. No install required !

Currently supported languages/framework/targets:

* **Bash** 3.1+ on Windows, Linux, OSX
* **C/C++** on Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS, Android (x86 & ARM), iOS and HTML5 (via Emscripten)
* **ObjectiveC** on OSX and iOS
* **Java** on Windows, Linux, OSX and Android
* **NodeJS** on Windows, Linux and OSX
* **Python 2.6 & 2.7** on Windows, Linux and OSX
* **Perl 5.6** on Windows, Linux and OSX
* **Git**, **SVN** and **Mercurial** on Windows, Linux and OSX
* **XSLT 1&2** on Windows, Linux, OSX
* **Emacs** on Windows, Linux, OSX
* **TeX** on Windows, Linux, OSX
* **Doxygen** on Windows and OSX
* **ffmpeg** on Windows
* **winutils** and **windbg** on Windows

Ham is MIT licensed, see the LICENSE section.

# Getting Started

This will NOT use or mess with any of your OS's setup ; it is completely self contained so that you can experiment safely and more importantly so that builds are easily reproducible on other computers/VMs.

If you plan to use all the toolchains you should have at least 5GB of free space where you'll be putting ham. The core stuff is only about 10-20MB.

If you don't have git download the latest version directly from:
https://github.com/prenaux/ham/archive/master.zip

Otherwise clone or pull the latest version of the ham repository:
```git clone https://github.com/prenaux/ham.git```

## Windows

No setup is required, just run ```ham-shell.cmd``` from the ```ham/bin``` directory and you'll be dropped in a Bash shell which has access to all the bash and ham commands. You can also use ```ham.cmd``` to run ham from third-party applications or from cmd.exe.

## OSX

Set bash as your default shell:
```
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Add this to ~/.profile:
```bash
export WORK="$HOME/My Work"
export HAM_HOME="$WORK/ham"
export PATH="${PATH}:$HAM_HOME/bin"

export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
export CLICOLOR=1
```

So that programs started from the Dock (such as Xcode) have access to $WORK, add this to launchd.conf:
```bash
# Open launchd.conf
sudo vi /etc/launchd.conf
# Add this in launchd.conf
setenv WORK /Users/USERNAME/Work
# Reload the env vars
sudo egrep "^setenv\ " /etc/launchd.conf | sudo xargs -t -L 1 launchctl
```

Note that launchd doesnt seem to be applied on reboot anymore in OSX 10.10 (Yosemite), so... there's yet another way to do that in OSX (environment.plist), but since it'll probably break next time Apple update the OS I won't bother - also as an added bonus its a real pain to setup. So the simplest way is to run "sudo egrep "^setenv\ " /etc/launchd.conf | sudo xargs -t -L 1 launchctl" after the OS booted. Its manual, and in 2015 it sucks that this simple stuff doesn't work, but that how it is.

Run 'ham-install-os-packages' to install the required dependencies using homebrow, this only needs to be done once:
```bash
ham-install-os-packages
```

## Linux

Add this to ~/.bashrc:
```bash
export WORK="${HOME}/My Work"
export HAM_HOME="$WORK/ham"
export PATH="${PATH}:$HAM_HOME/bin"
```

Run 'ham-install-os-packages' to install the required dependencies using apt-get, this only needs to be done once:
```bash
ham-install-os-packages
```

# Toolsets

A toolset contains a set of tools, its also commonly called a toolchain.

The following instructions all assume that you are in a 'ham shell' (see the Getting Started section).

The general command to import/setup a toolset is:
```
. ham-toolset TOOLSET1 ... TOOLSET2
```

Most of the time you will only use a single toolset since most will automatically import all their dependencies:
```
. ham-toolset TOOLSET
```

'hat' is a shorthand for 'ham-toolset':
```
. hat TOOLSET
```

When you import a toolset all the necessary binaries will be downloaded so in most case you won't need to install or download any third-party package to get them working.

## Default

The default toolset will setup the OS's default C and C++ compilers, the Java JDK 1.6 and the XSLT tools.

Type:
```
. hat default
```

## Repos (Git & SVN)

The repos toolset makes sure git and SVN are available. It will also make Mercurial (hg) accessible if it can be found on the system.

Type:
```
. hat repos
```

## Emacs

Ham includes an emacs toolset on all supported platform. The emacs toolsets contains
a good default environment that is suitable to edit all the languages supported by ham (and more).

On Windows the Emacs binaries are included in the toolset, on OSX & Linux you should install Emacs 23+.

### .emacs
Example ~/.emacs file:
```el
(setenv "WORK" "/Users/Pierre/MyWork")
(setenv "HAM_HOME" "/Users/Pierre/MyWork/ham")
(setenv "EMACS_DEVENV" (getenv "HAM_HOME"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat (getenv "HAM_HOME") "/sources/emacs"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat (getenv "HAM_HOME") "/sources/emacs/site"))

(require 'ni-user-pierre)
;; (require 'ni-theme-wombat)

;; (ni-turn-off-christmas)
```

Note that on Windows the emacs toolset is will the above .emacs if none exists.

## Emscripten

Ham + Emscripten requires about 1GB of disk space.

- Import the Emscripten toolset in the shell with ```. ham-toolset emscripten```. This can take a while the first time as it will download all the dependencies needed to run Emscripten ; that is: emscripten, nodejs, java_jdk16 and python_27.

- If the download of the packages is interrupted just re-run ```. ham-toolset emscripten``` it will resume from where it left off.

- Once the toolset has been imported it will print the toolset's info, it should look like this:

```
I/Imported toolset 'python_27'.
I/Imported toolset 'nodejs'.
I/Imported toolset 'java_jdk16'.
I/Imported toolset 'xslt_tools'.
I/Imported toolset 'emscripten'.
I/Toolset 'emscripten' setup successful.
=======================================================
=== Main Toolset ======================================
=======================================================
HAM_IMPORTED_TOOLSET = emscripten
HAM_TOOLSET = EMSCRIPTEN
HAM_TOOLSET_NAME = emscripten
HAM_TOOLSET_DIR = /Users/USERNAME/My Work/ham/toolsets/emscripten
=======================================================
=== Tools Version =====================================
=======================================================
--- python_27 ------------------------
Python 2.7.6
--- nodejs ------------------------

Copyright (C) 2014 the Emscripten authors (see AUTHORS.txt)
This is free and open source software under the MIT license.

=======================================================
```
- Now you can use 'emcc' and all the Emscripten command line tools from the shell's command line.

### Test
```
. ham-toolset emscripten
cd "$HAM_HOME/sources/ham/tests/pi"
emcc pi.c -o pi.html
```
This should output pi.html in the current directory.

Open pi.html in your web browser, it should print in the console view:
```
PI version 1.0.0 (argc:1,argv:0x501020)
pi ~= 3.14159065, with 500000 iterations
```

# Jam/FT-Jam

Ham (the make replacement part) is a derivative of "FT-Jam" which is itself a
derivative of the Jam build tool, based and 100% compatible with Jam 2.5.

- The FT-Jam homepage: http://www.freetype.org/jam/
- The original Jam homepage: http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html

http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html is a good resource to get familiar with the Jam language, however "Ham" has made quite a few change to default rules. See ``ham/rules/base.ham``` for an overview.
